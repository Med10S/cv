\begin{cvletter}

    I am writing to express my strong interest in the Winter 2026 Technical Co-op position as a Cyber Security Architect at Lockheed Martin Canada. As a final-year engineering student specializing in Networks and Telecommunications with a focus on cybersecurity at the National School of Applied Sciences of Fez (ENSAF), I am eager to contribute my technical skills, analytical mindset, and passion for information security to your Naval Development team.

    My academic background and hands-on experience have provided me with a solid foundation in cybersecurity, system architecture, and risk management. During my recent internship, I designed and deployed a Security Operations Center (SOC), integrated SIEM/SOAR solutions, and automated incident response workflows. These experiences have strengthened my ability to analyze threats and vulnerabilities, implement security controls, and work collaboratively in multidisciplinary teams.

    I am particularly interested in the opportunity to develop cybersecurity solutions for national and international programs at Lockheed Martin. I have experience with system hardening, network security, and continuous monitoring, and am familiar with security standards such as ITSG-33. My programming skills in Python and C, combined with my aptitude for problem-solving and my ability to adapt quickly, make me well-suited for an Agile team environment.

    I am recognized for my initiative, autonomy, and strong communication skills, both with technical and non-technical stakeholders. As president of the SECOPS club at ENSAF, I have led cybersecurity awareness initiatives, organized workshops, and fostered a collaborative environment for skill development.

    I am highly motivated by the prospect of joining Lockheed Martin Canada, contributing to innovative defense solutions, and growing within a company that values integrity, respect, and exceptional performance. I am available for a four-month co-op starting January 2026.

    Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and motivation can contribute to the success of Lockheed Martin Canada.
