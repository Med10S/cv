\begin{cvletter}


    I am writing to express my strong interest in the Final Year Internship position as a Cybersecurity Analyst (GRC) at VINCI Construction SI. As a 5th year engineering student specializing in Networks and Telecommunications with a focus on cybersecurity at the National School of Applied Sciences of Fez (ENSAF), I am eager to contribute my technical skills, analytical mindset, and passion for information security to your dynamic team.

    Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a solid foundation in cybersecurity, risk management, and project-based teamwork. My recent internship at the University Hospital Center of Fez allowed me to design and deploy a Security Operations Center (SOC), integrate SIEM/SOAR solutions (Wazuh, TheHive, Cortex, MISP), and automate incident response workflows. These experiences have strengthened my ability to manage security projects, implement best practices, and collaborate with multidisciplinary teams.

    I am particularly drawn to VINCI Construction SI’s commitment to digital transformation, innovation, and the professional development of its interns. The opportunity to work within the Cybersecurity department, supporting teams in the implementation of security solutions, formalizing recommendations, and following up on audit action plans, aligns perfectly with my career goals. My knowledge of ISO 27001, risk analysis methodologies (EBIOS RM), and my experience with security tools and project management will enable me to quickly adapt and add value to your team.

    Beyond my technical skills, I am recognized for my organizational abilities, critical thinking, and strong interpersonal skills. As president of the SECOPS club at ENSAF, I have led cybersecurity awareness initiatives, organized workshops, and fostered a collaborative environment for skill development.

    I am highly motivated by the prospect of joining VINCI Construction SI, contributing to your cybersecurity challenges, and growing within a company that values innovation and continuous learning. I am available to start the internship in October 2026 and am enthusiastic about the possibility of continuing my career with you after the internship.

    Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and motivation can contribute to the success of VINCI Construction SI.
